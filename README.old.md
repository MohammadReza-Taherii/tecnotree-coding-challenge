FE assignment
Create a React app that will present a gallery of 6 random dog images from
https://random.dog/woof.json
Allow the user to choose one (or more) to favorite (use local storage).
If the user doesnâ€™t like any of the six, use a refresh/next button to get 6 more. Repeat.
There should be two endpoints.

/favorites - displays all the favorite dogs
